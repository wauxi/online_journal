		<p>Then there's <span class="highlight">Chloe Price</span>. What do you say to your <span class="circle">best friend</span> after 5 years of silence? After finding out you saved her life in a bathroom? <span class="cross">NOTHING</span>. I feel so lame for not staying in touch... or even text. I have no idea how to process seeing Chloe like this again. For one thing, she looks so similar but so different... She's all grown up now, but it doesn't seem like she's only one year older than me.</p>

		<p>I absolutely love her <span class="box">blue hair and punk clothes</span>. It makes sense she would become a rebel. She still kinda looks like a pirate. Except one who stage dives. I know she's angry with me. I'm glad I can still see the old Chloe in there. Or is that the <span class="underline">young Chloe</span>? I'm sure she's still messed up about her dad dying. I would be too. That was a terrible time for Chloe and Joyce.</p>

		<p><span class="bracket">I feel bad because I wonder if I was happy to move away just to avoid the grief...</span> Speaking of grief, it's clear she's all mixed up with <span class="strike">Nathan Prescott's</span> shit. I have no idea what's going on between them, but I am going to find out, no matter what.</p>
