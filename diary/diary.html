      <p>Chloe woke me up earlyy- like 4am early! I mean all in good reason and it's not like a could be mad at her long- all she had to do was look at me with those bright blue eyes and I'd be a flustered Max puddle ready to wait on her hand and foot... not even worth trying to stay in bed.</p>
      <p>It was worth it though.</p>
      <p>We stumbled out into the freezing cold air and at that point I almost gave up, tugging at her sleeve and complaining as the frozen air and snowflakes attacked my face.</p>

      <p>But I'm glad the <span class="box">punk</span> managed to convince me to go further and also put up with my whining like a kid on a car trip the whole way...</p>

      <p>We walked further and yeah by this point I was really starting to enjoy myself. Apart from the cold the sky was so clear and littered with stars and the snow capped trees looked like something out of a video game!</p>
      <p>Anyways after about fifteen minutes Chloe stopped me at the top of a hill. I was fully questioning it but as the sun came up I really started to understand why she had dragged my <span class="cross">disoriented</span> ass over here.</p>
      <p>We both took a seat on the ridge of the cliff, Chloe had brought a blanket so we didn't get wet but's haha. She cuddled up to me and we sat and watched the sunrise together, it was so <span class="bracket">cheesy</span> or as Chloe would say "mushy" but I'm such a sucker for that and I loved every minute.</p>
